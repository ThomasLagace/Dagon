INTRODUCTION
============
Why am I making this?
---------------------
I really just want a personal blogging site to use. That's 'bout it.

What do I need on the server / client side?
-------------------------------------------
I don't really know if it'll work with anything else, but I'm using
* An Apache webserver
* PHP 7
* PostgreSQL
